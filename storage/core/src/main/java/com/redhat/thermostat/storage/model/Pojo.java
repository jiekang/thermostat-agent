/**
 * All data types should implement this empty interface, to support the
 * generalization of DAO code where possible.
 *
 * In order to enable fully automatic serialization and deserialization of
 * data objects, an implementation of this interface needs to adhere to
 * a certain set of rules, that essentially boil down to compliance with
 * JavaBeans specification plus Thermostat's @Entity and @Persist annotation.
 * In detail those rules are:
 *
 * - A Pojo class needs to be annotated with @Entity (in addition to it implementing
 *   Pojo).
 * - Only properties will be (de-)serialized, other method or fields will not
 *   be looked at.
 * - Properties that should be (de-)serialized need to be annotated with @Persist,
 *   both on the getter and the setter method.
 * - Serializable properties need to either be of primitive type, or String or
 *   other Pojos or arrays (indexed properties) of those types. (The reason for supporting
 *   only arrays as opposed to collections is that arrays carry type information,
 *   while collections don't, due to type erasure in Java generics. The type information
 *   is needed in order to re-construct the objects when deserializing.)
 * - The properties need to be of the same type that its signatures declare. Specifically,
 *   they must not be of a subclass of that type. The reason for that is that
 *   the type information of the signature is used in deserialization. This also implies
 *   that such properties cannot be of abstract types.
